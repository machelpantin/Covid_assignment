# **Introduction to Data Analysis with Python - Final Project**
In this final project you will be able to integrate the knowledge acquired throughout the course by implementing a practical application that we hope will serve as a starting point for the creation of many more projects in your future of all kinds of complexity.

**Project objectives**:

* That the participant masters the basics of Python programming.
* That the participant has elementary knowledge about reading files, data processing, and data visualization.
* That the participant can find and apply knowledge that goes beyond those explained in the course.
* That the participant has an experience of applying Python programming to a practical example.

Different project options are presented, of comparable difficulty, so that each one can choose the one they consider most interesting, that is, they must carry out only one of the projects among the options.

**Deadline**:
  * **December 22, 2020**

** Delivery method **:
  * **A .ipynb file must be delivered (Jupyter Notebook) by email sXX@gmail.com**

** Delivery details: **

* In the Python code file **, the explanations of the operation of the program and the reasons for its solution will be valued in the correctness **. This can be done by comments in the code.

* In addition to the Python code, **you must send a graph** in * .PNG * format generated using * matplotlib * **following the instructions in the project description**. This helps you and us to know that you are on the right track.

* The program must be **robust**, that is, with little probability of failing when altering its input. If the format of the user input is not as expected **the program should not * crash***, but handle the situation accordingly. A strategy to detect possible failures is to imagine that a person is bent on producing an error in his program and think: ** What would this person try to break the code? ** This involves, for example, contemplating cases in which the user enters text when a number is expected, or you enter an unknown value, a key not found in a dictionary, an index larger than the size of a list, etc.

* You are free to use your own criteria to decide how to implement those details that are not specified in the description.

* The description of the projects specifies the minimum characteristics that they must have. **We give freedom to add functionality or improve the project if they wish, as long as all the minimum requirements detailed in the description are met**.

**Correction:**

* If the project is approved, the course is considered completed.

* If it is considered that the project still has details to be corrected, a redelivery may be requested at a later date.
